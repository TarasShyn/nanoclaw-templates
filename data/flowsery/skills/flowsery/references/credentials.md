# Credentials and connection errors

Flowsery is authenticated by the credential gateway, which adds the key to
every request for `mcp.flowsery.com`. You never see or handle the key. Read
this only when the connection fails.

## Symptoms

- The `mcp__flowsery__*` tools are missing from your tool list, or a call
  returns 401, "Authentication required" or "not connected": no key is
  stored for `mcp.flowsery.com` yet, or the stored one was revoked.
- A call returns 401 with `token_issuer_lost_access`: the member who created
  the key left the workspace or was deactivated. The key is dead.
- A call returns 403 with `permission_denied`: the key's role cannot use
  Flowsery. A workspace key needs the Editor or Admin role; Contributor and
  Viewer keys are refused. The user needs a new key with the Editor role.
- "Website ID or domain is required": call `list_websites` and pass
  `websiteId` or `domain`. Not a credential problem.
- A call returns 429: rate limited (600 requests a minute per key). Wait for
  `Retry-After` seconds; do not loop.

## What to tell the user

1. Say Flowsery is not connected yet. If the gateway's error carried a
   `connect_url`, show it as a bare URL on its own line.
2. Tell them how to make the key:
   - Sign in at https://flowsery.com and open the workspace **API Tokens**
     page (https://flowsery.com/api-tokens).
   - Create a workspace token for this agent only, with the **Editor** role,
     so it can be revoked on its own. It starts with `flow_ws_` and reaches
     every website in the workspace.
   - Copy it; it is shown once.
3. They store it in the gateway for host `mcp.flowsery.com`, header
   `Authorization`, value `Bearer <key>`: through the connect link, the
   gateway dashboard, or the command in the template README.
4. Ask them to tell you when it is done, then retry the original request.
   If the tools were missing, the agent may need a restart
   (`ncl groups restart`) before they appear.

Never ask the user to paste the key into chat. If they paste one anyway, tell
them to revoke it in Flowsery and make a new one, because chat history is
not a safe place for it.
